Q1. L1 RMSE training/validation/test: 0.678, 0.712, 0.583
	L2 RMSE training/validaton/test: 0.678, 0.711, 0.464

	RMSE Normal Equations: training, validation: 0.711, 0.73

	RMSE SGD: training, validation: 0.68, 0.71

	It is observed the mean RMSE values obtained by gradient descent are slightly 
	better (by a magnitude of order 1e-2) as compared to RMSE values obtained by 
	Normal Equations.

Q2. Regularization (higher lambda values) actually gave a worse fit as compared
	to standard SGD. All regularized lines eventually converge to the one found 
	by SGD when regularization parameters ~ 1e-7.
