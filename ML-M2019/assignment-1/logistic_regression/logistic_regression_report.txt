Q1. Training accuracy for L1: ~ 0.80
	Training accuracy for L2: ~ 0.75

	Validation accuracy for L1 ~ 0.42  
	Validation accuracy for L2 ~ 0.45
	
	Testing accuracy for L1 ~ 0.30
	Testing accuracy for L2 ~ 0.35

	L2 regularization is performing better during testing due to smaller weight updates
	as iterations occur, which is also the reason why L1 regularization performs better
	with a constant step update. Also, the model is sparse and has high variance. L2 
	regularization performs better on test data with higher variance as compared to 
	L1 regularization.

Q2. Using Stochastic Averaged Gradient method because of sparse matrices!

	L1 training accuracy: 0.889
	L1 testing accuracy: 0.892

	L2 training accuracy: 0.889
	L2 testing accuracy: 0.89
